Zintl compounds are usually rich in composition and thus enable a large degree of manipulation in both electronic and phononic properties for potential thermoelectric applications. This is typified by the AB2C2 compounds (A = Eu, Yb, Ba, Ca; B = Zn, Cd, Mg and C = As, Sb, Bi) that have attracted extensive attention. Among this class of compounds, a few existing works indicate that the high thermoelectric performance in p-type EuZn2Sb2 relies on its relatively high mobility and the reported figures of merit are scattered. This has motivated this study to focus on the thermoelectric transport properties of p-EuZn2-xAgxSb2 (Ag-doped) in a broad carrier concentration range (3.5-14 ?? 1019 cm-3), which reveals a single parabolic band (SPB) behavior in this material and enables insights into the fundamental material parameters determining the thermoelectric performance. This finding has guided a further enhancement to be achieved by a reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity, which is realized by a strong phonon scattering through the Ca/Eu isovalent substitutional defects. The achieved peak figure of merit, zT, was as high as unity, demonstrating EuZn2Sb2 as a promising thermoelectric material.",1

The data also indicate that the flight speed and elevation are not constant, but oscillate in synchrony with both the horizontal and vertical movements of the wing. PIV measurements in the transverse (Trefftz) plane of the wake indicate a complex 'wake vortex' structure dominated by a strong wing tip vortex shed from the wing tip during the downstroke and either the wing tip or a more proximal joint during the upstroke.

Additionally, the effects of Cu dopants on the electrical and thermal transport properties have been systematically investigated. Besides introducing additional holes, Cu dopants can also significantly enhance the carrier mobility by decreasing the Debye screen length and weakening the interaction between carriers and phonons.

Taking La- and I-doped PbTe as an example, the current work shows the effects of optimizing the thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, by controlling the doping level. The high doping effectiveness allows the carrier concentration to be precisely designed and prepared to control the Fermi level. In addition to the Fermi energy tuning, La-doping modifies the conduction band, leading to an increase in the density of states effective mass that is confirmed by transport, infrared reflectance and hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Taking such a band structure modification effect into account, the electrical transport properties can then be well-described by a self-consistent single non-parabolic Kane band model that yields an approximate (mƒ??T)1.5 dependence of the optimal carrier concentration for a peak power factor in both doping cases. Such a simple temperature dependence also provides an effective approximation of carrier concentration for a peak zT and helps to explain, the effects of other strategies such as lowering the lattice thermal conductivity by nanostructuring or alloying in n-PbTe, which demonstrates a practical guide for fully optimizing thermoelectric materials in the entire temperature range. The principles used here should be equally applicable to other thermoelectric materials.",1
10.1039/c8ee00112j,"?? 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Thermoelectric properties are heavily dependent on the carrier concentration, and therefore the optimization of carrier concentration plays a central role in achieving high thermoelectric performance. The optimized carrier concentration is highly temperature-dependent and could even possibly vary within one order of magnitude in the temperature range of several hundreds of Kelvin. Practically, however, the traditional doping strategy will only lead to a constant carrier concentration, and thus the thermoelectric performance is only optimized within a limited temperature range. Here, we demonstrate that a temperature-dependent carrier concentration can be realized by simultaneously introducing shallow and deep defect levels. In this work, iodine (I) and indium (In) are co-doped in PbTe, where iodine acts as the shallow donor level that supplies sufficient electrons and indium builds up the localized half-filled deep defect state in the band gap. The indium deep defect state traps electrons at a lower temperature and the trapped electrons will be thermally activated back to the conduction band when the temperature rises. In this way, the carrier concentration can be engineered as temperature-dependent, which matches the theoretically predicted optimized carrier concentration over the whole temperature range. As a result, a room temperature ZT of ƒ?¬0.4 and a peak ZT of ƒ?¬1.4 at 773 K were obtained in the n-type In/I co-doped PbTe, leading to a record-high average ZT of ƒ?¬1.04 in the temperature range of 300 to 773 K. Importantly, since deep defect levels also exist in other materials, the strategy of deep defect level engineering should be widely applicable to a variety of materials for enhancing the thermoelectric performance across a broad temperature range.",1

The relatively inferior performance of n-type legs impedes the application of PbTe materials in intermediate temperature thermoelectric devices. In order to elevate the thermoelectric properties of n-type PbTe, we added some Sb phases into 0.1% PbI2-doped PbTe by a conventional melting method. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis together with density function theory (DFT) calculations showed that endotaxial Sb nanoprecipitates were produced in the PbTe samples at room temperature, and that part of these nanoprecipitates gradually dissolved into the PbTe matrix to form SbPb-SbTe dual-site substitutional point defects as temperature increased. A maximum ZT of about 1.8 was achieved at 773 K for the n-type PbTe0.998I0.002-3%Sb composite due to a simultaneous improvement in power factor and reduction in lattice thermal conductivity. In the PbTe0.998I0.002-x%Sb (x = 1-4) composite samples, the Seebeck coefficient was much higher than that of the reported single-phase PbTe samples with similar carrier concentration, which mainly originated from distortion of the density-of-states caused by Sb dual-site doping. Simulations based on the Callaway model suggested that the SbPb-SbTe dual-site substitutional point defects also played an important role in decreasing the lattice thermal conductivity at elevated temperature. We propose that the synergistic role of Sb in both electrical and thermal transport should be highly applicable in other bulk thermoelectric materials.",1

KGaA, Weinheim A high ZT (thermoelectric figure of merit) of ƒ??1.4 at 900 K for n-type PbTe is reported, through modifying its electrical and thermal properties by incorporating Sb and S, respectively. Sb is confirmed to be an amphoteric dopant in PbTe, filling Te vacancies at low doping levels (<1%), exceeding which it enters into Pb sites. It is found that Sb-doped PbTe exhibits much higher carrier mobility than similar Bi-doped materials, and accordingly, delivers higher power factors and superior ZT. The enhanced electronic transport is attributed to the elimination of Te vacancies, which appear to strongly scatter n-type charge carriers. Building on this result, the ZT of Pb0.9875Sb0.0125Te is further enhanced by alloying S into the Te sublattice. The introduction of S opens the bandgap of PbTe, which suppresses bipolar conduction while simultaneously increasing the electron concentration and electrical conductivity. Furthermore, it introduces point defects and induces second phase nanostructuring, which lowers the lattice thermal conductivity to ƒ??0.5 W mƒ??1 Kƒ??1 at 900 K, making this material a robust candidate for high-temperature (500ƒ??900 K) thermoelectric applications.

The combination of a large density-of-states effective mass m* ƒ?¬ 2.6 me arising from the enhanced valley degeneracy Nv, high mobility ?¬d due to low deformation potential Ed (8.77-9.43 eV), and ultra-low alloy scattering parameter Ea (0.32-0.39 eV) leads to an outstanding power factor, PFmax ƒ? (m*) 3/2?¬d, of up to 4.7 mW m-1 K-2 at around 600 K.

10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.166601,"Mg 2Si and Mg 2Sn are indirect band gap semiconductors with two low-lying conduction bands (the lower mass and higher mass bands) that have their respective band edges reversed in the two compounds. Consequently, for some composition x, Mg 2Si 1-xSn x solid solutions must display a convergence in energy of the two conduction bands. Since Mg 2Si 1-xSn x solid solutions are among the most prospective of the novel thermoelectric materials, we aim on exploring the influence of such a band convergence (valley degeneracy) on the Seebeck coefficient and thermoelectric properties in a series of Mg 2Si 1-xSn x solid solutions uniformly doped with Sb. Transport measurements carried out from 4 to 800 K reveal a progressively increasing Seebeck coefficient that peaks at x=0.7. At this concentration the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT reaches exceptionally large values of 1.3 near 700K. Our first principles calculations confirm that at the Sn content x 0.7 the two conduction bands coincide in energy. We explain the high Seebeck coefficient and ZT values as originating from an enhanced density-of-states effective mass brought about by the increased valley degeneracy as the two conduction bands cross over. We corroborate the increase in the density-of-states effective mass by measurements of the low temperature specific heat. The research suggests that striving to achieve band degeneracy by means of compositional variations is an effective strategy for enhancing the thermoelectric properties of these materials. ?? 2012 American Physical Society.",1

The overall photoelectron spectral feature of Fe2VAl1-zGez with the Ge content z up to 0.10 is not so much changed, except for the main 3d band in the region from the Fermi level EF to the binding energy EB ? 1 eV. For z = 0.05, the leading edge of the main band is shifted by ?0.07 eV, but the shift is much smaller than expected within a rigid band model for a calculated band structure. For z = 0.10, a band at EB ? 0.5 eV becomes prominent and the intensity of the Fermi edge is increased. The change in the valence band spectrum near EF suggests the rigid-band-like shift of the 3d bands and the appearance of new 3d states in the pseudogap, which may qualitatively explain the z-dependence of the thermoelectric properties. As z increases, the V 2p spectra show a shift towards the high binding energy and the evolution of a shoulder structure on the low binding energy side of the main line. The shoulder structure is attributed to the charge transfer to the V site induced by the Ge substitution as well as the surface effect.

The optimal periodic length corresponds to an order of magnitude (92%) decrease in thermal conductivity at room temperature, compared to pristine single-crystalline Si nanowires.

The sample added 0.5 mass% or more ANPs increased both the electrical resistivity and the thermal conductivity. As a result, the sample added 0.05 mass% ANPs had the maximum performance of ZT = 1.15 at 873 K.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10971-012-2831-6,"Three different water based sol–gel methods were compared in the synthesis of Bi2Sr2Co1.8Ox thermoelectric ceramics. We chose methods that can stabilize a Bi3+ ion while solution and gel are formed: chelating method using combination of ethylenediamintetraacetic acid (EDTA) and triethanolamine (TEA) chelating agents and, further, synthesis using two different water soluble polymers—polyacrylamide or polyethylenimin. In each sol–gel process, we tested two gel decomposition atmospheres. The gels were decomposed either in air or in inert atmosphere (followed by treatment in pure oxygen). Additionally, a sample synthesized by solid state reaction was used for comparison with the sol–gel prepared samples. The grain size of precursors and also their phase composition were determined for methods used and different gels decomposition atmospheres. The sintered final samples did not differ in phase composition; on the other hand, they vary in volume density and microstructure. The differences were reflected in electric transport measurement (the temperature dependence of Seebeck coefficient, resistivity and thermal conductivity). The use of EDTA/TEA or PEI methods led to the samples with improved thermoelectric parameters in comparison to the solid state sample.",0
https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4757632,"We have prepared polycrystalline samples of (Sr1?xLax)2ErRuO6(Sr1?xLax)2ErRuO6 and (Sr1?xLax)2YRuO6(Sr1?xLax)2YRuO6, and have measured the resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity, susceptibility, and x-ray absorption in order to evaluate the electronic states and thermoelectric properties of the doped double-perovskite ruthenates. We have observed a large Seebeck coefficient of ?160??V/K?160??V/K and a low thermal conductivity of 7 mW/cmK for x?=?0.1 at 800?K in air. These two values are suitable for efficient oxide thermoelectrics, although the resistivity is still as high as 1 ???cm???cm. From the susceptibility and x-ray absorption measurements, we find that the doped electrons exist as Ru4+Ru4+ in the low spin state. On the basis of the measured results, the electronic states and the conduction mechanism are discussed.",0
